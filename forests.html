    <p data-aos="fade-in">
        Approximately 31% of the planet's geographical area is covered by forests, which are essential to the ecosystem. Approximately 80% of terrestrial biodiversity is found in these varied ecosystems, which are home to millions of different species of plants, animals, and microbes. Because they release oxygen back into the atmosphere and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, they are essential to the stability of the global climate. In addition, forests control water cycles, stop soil erosion, and improve air quality.<br><br>
        Furthermore, millions of people around the world rely on them as vital sources of income for businesses like ecotourism, agriculture, and forestry. Despite their significance, forests are under threat from a variety of sources, such as illegal logging, deforestation, habitat damage, and climate change. As a result, conservation efforts and sustainable forest management techniques are desperately needed to guarantee the survival of forests for future generations.

    <h2 id="types-of-forests" data-aos="fade-in">Types of forests in the world</h2>
    <br><br>
    <h3 data-aos="fade-in">1) Boreal Forests</h3>
        <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/uru_vSPZnYVExZZCzz9EttQWc6A=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lake-to-sky-1299538498-fffdaedc728148ecae844a38072bf5c2.jpg" alt="image of a boreal forest" class="center" data-aos="fade-in" >
        <p data-aos="fade-in">Boreal forests, also known as taiga, occupy regions between 50 and 60 degrees latitude across North America, Asia, and Europe. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the terrain beneath these forests bears testament to its geological history, influencing its hydrology and soil composition. With an inhospitable climate characterized by bitter cold temperatures, boreal forests harbor relatively low biodiversity compared to temperate and tropical forests. Nonetheless, the flora and fauna inhabiting these regions have evolved unique adaptations to endure short growing seasons and harsh environmental conditions. Renowned for their expansive and remote landscapes, boreal forests play a crucial role in sequestering carbon.
        <br><br>Notably, boreal forests experience the shortest growing seasons among the three forest types, typically lasting around 130 days. The soil in these forests tends to be shallow, acidic, and lacking in nutrients. Coniferous trees dominate the canopy, although certain deciduous species like willows, poplars, and alders thrive as well. Key tree species include black and white fir, jackpine, balsam fir, and tamarack. Beneath the canopy, blueberry and cranberry bushes flourish, providing a rich source of high-energy sustenance for wildlife.</p>
    
    <br><br>

    <h3 data-aos="fade-in">2) Temperate Forests</h3>
        <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/3aGuh8gt54JBje0qN6iq37VLBs0=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/autumn-colorful-trees-texture-background--1281519650-c0af79b74daf429ea29e62fd6b3835a2.jpg" alt="image of a temperature forest" class="center" data-aos="fade-in" >
        <p data-aos="fade-in">Temperate forests, situated in mid-latitudes, boast distinct four-season cycles owing to their geographic positioning. Despite their significance, only remnants of old-growth temperate forests persist, as secondary forests dominate the landscape. As of 2020, temperate forests comprised 16% of the Earth's total forest coverage.
        <br><br>Inhabited by species finely attuned to seasonal shifts, temperate forests host a diverse array of flora and fauna. Deciduous trees such as maples, hickories, and oaks shed their leaves during fall and winter, entering a dormant phase to conserve energy. Meanwhile, creatures like bears, bobcats, squirrels, and deer have adapted various strategies like food storage, dietary adjustments, or hibernation to navigate the challenges posed by winter's scarcity of nutritious resources.
        <br><br>While sharing a common trait of seasonality, temperate forests exhibit considerable variability in precipitation and temperature from year to year. Annual temperature ranges span from -22 degrees Fahrenheit to 86 degrees Fahrenheit, contingent upon location and season. Rainfall averages between 30 to 59 inches annually. Characterized by fertile soils enriched with a substantial layer of organic matter, temperate forests provide a nourishing substrate from which plants derive essential nutrients for growth.</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <h3 data-aos="fade-in">3) Tropical Forests</h3>
        <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/dxsBD7iU7t--_zkOVeszPwhB8yk=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tropical-dense-cloud-forest-coverd-in-fog--central-africa-184272941-fad00d9ad6cd45328a26b09a43dcf978.jpg" alt="image of a tropical forest" class="center" data-aos="fade-in">
        <p data-aos="fade-in">Situated between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn at approximately 23 degrees north and south latitudes, tropical forests stand as unparalleled bastions of biodiversity on our planet. Despite covering merely a tenth of Earth's surface, they host an astonishing fifty percent of all known species. Regrettably, these vital ecosystems face significant threats from human activities, as highlighted by recent studies.
        <br><br>Tropical forests maintain remarkably stable environmental conditions conducive to life's proliferation. They represent the warmest and most humid forests globally, with temperatures ranging from 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit and annual rainfall varying between 79 to 394 inches.
        Renowned for their unparalleled biodiversity, tropical forests, such as the Amazon rainforest, shelter an impressive 10% of the world's documented species.
        <br><br>The rich diversity of tropical forests contributes to their exceptional efficiency in nutrient cycling. Rapid decomposition of organic matter by decomposers ensures swift nutrient recycling, facilitating instant uptake by other organisms. Consequently, soils in tropical forests tend to be nutrient-deficient. To adapt to these conditions, many tropical tree species have evolved shallow root systems that sprawl across the forest floor, enabling them to efficiently absorb nutrients from the substrate.</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <h3 data-aos="fade-in">4) Subtropical Forests</h3>
        <img src="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/images/temperate_forest_WW197028_Andrew_S._Wright/story_full_width/4emwz92uzm_Medium_WW197028.jpg" alt="image of a subtropical forest" class="center" data-aos="fade-in">
        <p data-aos="fade-in">Subtropical forests inhabit the transition areas between tropical and temperate climates, offering a distinctive mix of environmental attributes. Marked by mild winters and hot, humid summers, these forests create an environment conducive to year-round luxuriant growth. Their vegetation showcases a diverse assortment of both evergreen and deciduous trees, featuring species like oak, hickory, pine, and magnolia alongside tropical flora such as palms. While not as biodiverse as tropical forests, 
        subtropical forests still harbor a rich variety of plant and animal life adapted to their specific conditions. Stretching across regions bordering tropical and temperate zones globally, including parts of the southeastern United States, eastern Australia, southern China, and South America, subtropical forests play a vital role in enhancing the ecological richness of our planet's landscapes.</p>
